= Using EnOS Integration SDK For Java
:toc:

== Installation

=== Prerequisites

==== Installing Java JDK SE

*Java SE 8* is required to use the SDK and run the samples.

==== Optional: Installing Maven

The Java SDK is maven-based. If you use Maven 3, you just need
to add the dependency upon the Java SDK to the main _pom.xml_
file of your project, saving the efforts to download and build from
source code.

For instructions on downloading and installing *Maven 3*, see
https://maven.apache.org/install.html[here].

=== Installing EnOS Integration SDK for Java

Select one of the following ways to install the Java SDK:

- If your project is maven-based, add the dependency on the Java SDK to the
main _pom.xml_ of your project.
- Download the source code and build on your machine.

=== Adding the Maven Dependency to Your Project

*This is the recommended method to use EnOS Integration SDK in your project.
Your project has to be a Maven project and you have installed Maven on
your machine.*

[arabic]
. Go to http://search.maven.org/[http://search.maven.org]. Search for
*com.enosiot enos-http-integration* and find the version number for the SDK that
you want to use.
. In your main _pom.xml_ file, add the dependency on the SDK of your
desired version by inserting the following code snippet:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.enos-iot</groupId>
    <artifactId>enos-http-integration</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.3</version>
    <!--This is latest current version number when this document is being written. Yours may vary.-->
</dependency>
----

==== Building From the Source Code

[arabic]
. Download the source code of *EnOS Integration SDK for Java* from the
*master* branch of the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/enos-iot/enos-integration-sdk-java
+
If you use the command-line interface, the command for download is as
follows:
+
[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/enos-iot/enos-integration-sdk-java.git
----
. Build the SDK from source code using the following command in your
command-line interface:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----

The compiled JAR file with all dependencies bundled can then be found in
the following file:

....
{Integration SDK for Java root}/target/enos-http-integration-{version}.jar
....

If you want to use the integration SDK in your own project, include this JAR
file and any JAR files that the integration SDK depends on in your project.

== Feature List

This integration SDK provides:

- Upload measurement points
- Upload attributes
- Upload events

File-type measurement points, attributes and events are supported.
This SDK also provides:
- Download file
- Delete file

== Quick Start

[arabic]
. Create an HTTP connection and specify the connection parameters.
+
[source,java]
----
// INTEGRATION_CHANNEL_URL is the URL of EnOS HTTP Integration Channel URL and API_GW_URL is the URL of API Gateway, 
// which can be obtained in the Environment Information page in EnOS Console
// The APP_KEY, APP_SECRET and ORG_ID can be obtain in Application Registration page in EnOS Console
HttpConnection connection = new HttpConnection.Builder(
        INTEGRATION_CHANNEL_URL, API_GW_URL, APP_KEY, APP_SECRET, ORG_ID)
        .build();
----
. Upload measurement points via the HTTP connection.
+
[source,java]
----
// Build a request to post a measurement point
// IntMeasurePoint and FileMeasurePoint is a measurement point defined in EnOS console > Model.
DeviceInfo deviceInfo = new DeviceInfo().setAssetId(ASSET_ID1);
IntegrationMeasurepointPostRequest request = IntegrationMeasurepointPostRequest.builder()
        .addMeasurepoint(deviceInfo, System.currentTimeMillis(), ImmutableMap.of("IntMeasurePoint", 100, "FileMeasurePoint", new File("sample.txt")))
        .build();
// Publish the request synchronously with progress listener if provided
IntegrationResponse response = connection.publish(request, progressListener);
